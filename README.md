# xopherw

The second personal flutter page and will be improved later on.

Version 2 has added my fserver media link with password dialog. The page itself also scrollable on my texts as well as the icon links, so the user will able to scroll around to look for contact. The page is also responsive to the pixel size to any devices. Version 2 may not be the end result of my own personal site, I will make a blogsite completely with flutter framework and work with some backend for it.
